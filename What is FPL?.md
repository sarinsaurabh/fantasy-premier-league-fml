# What is Fantasy Premier League (FPL)?

## Introduction to the Premier League

The **Premier League** is the top tier of English professional football (soccer). It consists of 20 teams competing in a 38-match season, running from August to May each year. These teams battle for the title, European qualification spots, and to avoid relegation. With global viewership in the hundreds of millions, it's one of the most followed football leagues in the world.

## What is Fantasy Premier League?

Fantasy Premier League is an online fantasy football game where players create virtual teams composed of real Premier League players and earn points based on those players' actual on-pitch performance. Instead of managing a club, you're a virtual "manager" building a squad within strict budget and squad constraints.

Every gameweek (typically a week during the season), points are awarded based on:
- **Goals scored** (+5 for outfield players, +4 for goalkeepers)
- **Assists** (+3 points)
- **Clean sheets** (+4 for defenders/goalkeepers)
- **Bonus points** for man-of-the-match performances
- **Penalties saved** (+5 for goalkeepers)
- **Minutes played** (1 point per 90 minutes)
- **Yellow/red cards** (-1/-3 points)

Your total score is the sum of all gameweeks' points, and you compete against friends, regional leagues, or the global community.
